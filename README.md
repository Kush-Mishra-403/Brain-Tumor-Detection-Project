# Brain Tumor Detection & Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on automated detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. The objective is to classify brain MRI scans into **healthy** and **tumor-affected** categories, reducing dependency on manual and error-prone diagnosis.

The system utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, and **Transfer Learning (TL)** to perform binary classification, with scope for tumor localization and segmentation.

## Problem Statement
Manual analysis of brain MRI scans is time-consuming and requires specialized medical expertise. Variations in tumor size, shape, and location further increase diagnostic complexity—especially in regions with limited access to skilled neurosurgeons. An automated AI-based system can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
